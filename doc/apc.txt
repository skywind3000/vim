Introduction ~

A tiny and portable script (169 lines) to provide you 'YouCompleteMe' like
experience for 'buffer', 'dictionary' and 'tags' completion without installing
heavy completion engines and building background servers.

What Is It ? ~

Semantic completion is great, but sometimes, when you are coding in an obscure
laguange which is lack of LSP support, or you are working in a temporary system
and you don't want waste time to set up a heavyweight completion engine and
build a background server.

In these circumstances, vim's built-in completion system is good enough for
you, it can collect keywords from buffers and dictionary or ctag files, but
requires you to press '<c-n>' or '<c-x><c-k>' manually.

This tiny little script will help you to trigger the completion menu when you
have entered 1 or 2 alphabets and provide you exactly the same experience like
'YouCompleteMe':

Features ~

- Popup the completion menu automatically.
- 'Tab' or 'shift'+'TAB' to cycle keywords, '<c-e>' to cancel.
- Same experience like 'YouCompleteMe' for 'buffer', 'dict' and 'tags'
  completion.
- Green, everything is local to buffer, will not pollute your vim or disturb
  other plugins.
- Capable to co-exist with other completion plugins.
- No heavy engines, no need to build background servers.
- Faster and more handy than the old famous 'AutoComplPop'.
- Portable, just a simple 'apc.vim' script, easy to be distributed.
- Only **169 lines**, you can even copy it to your 'vimrc'.
- Convenience as a backup way for big completion plugins.

Usage ~

That's all you need:
>
  Plug 'skywind3000/vim-auto-popmenu'
  
  " enable this plugin for filetypes, '*' for all files.
  let g:apc_enable_ft = {'text':1, 'markdown':1, 'php':1}
  
  " source for dictionary, current or other loaded buffers, see ':help cpt'
  set cpt=.,k,w,b
  
  " don't select the first item.
  set completeopt=menu,menuone,noselect
  
  " suppress annoy messages.
  set shortmess+=c
<
And perhaps a dictionary database plugin for many languages:
>
  Plug 'skywind3000/vim-dict'
<
Then you go.
