Introduction ~

I use vscode for markdown editing and vscode has a 'CTRL+backtick' hot key to
toggle internal terminal. I use it a lot and it's very handy. At the meantime
both vim/nvim have internal terminal too, but most of us still prefer working
in a tmux split rather than using the internal terminal.

Therefor, I started to wonder, is there something I can do, to make vim's
internal terminal has a better experience ? As a result, here this plugin
exists with three little changes:

Firstly, this plugin setup a keymap 'ALT+=' (can be changed) to toggle terminal
window, like vscode's 'CTRL+backtick'. When you press 'ALT+=' it will open a
new terminal below your current window, and initiate the shell working
directory to where the parent directory of current file. Most time you want to
do something to the current file, so open the shell in the current file
directory will make life easier.

When you finished, just press 'ALT+=' again to hide the terminal, so you always
press 'ALT+=' to toggle your terminal window, but if you run 'exit' and quit
the previous terminal session and hit 'ALT+=' again, a new terminal will be
created.

In addition, you are able to use 'ALT+SHIFT+h/j/k/l' to move around between
windows. Most vim users uses 'CTRL+h/j/k/l' for window switching, but these
keys are heavily used in the terminal applications, for example if you use
'tnoremap' to override 'CTRL+j' or 'CTRL+k', you will not be able to use them
in fzf. So 'CTRL+h/j/k/l' will not be used for 'tnoremap', 'terminal-help'
encourage you to use the new 'ALT+SHIFT+h/j/k/l' to jump between windows.

Finally, it provides a 'drop' command in the internal terminal to tell outside
vim to open a file. When you are working in the internal terminal and you want
to edit a file in the current directory (not vim's 'pwd'), how do you do ?
Especially the 'pwd' in the terminal is different of vim's 'pwd'. You have to
switch to terminal normal mode and use vim 'e' command with a long path name.

With 'drop' command, it is simple to tell outside vim open a specific file
precisely:
>
  cd /xxx/some/where
  drop abc.txt
<
I always believe that small changes can make big difference.

Usage ~

- 'ALT' + '=': toggle terminal below.
- 'ALT' + 'SHIFT' + 'h': move to the window on the left.
- 'ALT' + 'SHIFT' + 'l': move to the window on the right.
- 'ALT' + 'SHIFT' + 'j': move to the window below.
- 'ALT' + 'SHIFT' + 'k': move to the window above.
- 'ALT' + 'SHIFT' + 'p': move to the previous window.
- 'ALT' + '-': paste register 0 to terminal.
- 'ALT' + 'q': switch to terminal normal mode.

Inside the terminal:
>
  drop abc.txt
<

                                                       *terminal_help-settings*
Settings ~

- 'g:terminal_key': which key will be used to toggle terminal window, default
  to '<m-=>'.
- 'g:terminal_cwd': initialize working dir: '0' for unchanged, '1' for file
  path and '2' for project root.
- 'g:terminal_height': new terminal height, default to 10.
- 'g:terminal_pos': where to open the terminal, default to 'rightbelow'.
- 'g:terminal_shell': specify shell rather than default one.
- 'g:terminal_edit': command to open the file in vim, default to 'tab drop'.
- 'g:terminal_kill': set to 'term' to kill term session when exiting vim.
- 'g:terminal_list': set to 0 to hide terminal buffer in the buffer list.
- 'g:terminal_fixheight': set to 1 to set 'winfixheight' for the terminal
  window.
- 'g:terminal_close': set to 1 to close window if process finished.

Remember ~

The internal terminal in both vim/neovim has 'NORMAL' and 'INSERT' mode. When
you are in 'INSERT' mode, you can enter shell commands. And if you want to
scroll terminal screen or copy / paste texts to a normal vim buffer, you need
to switch to 'NORMAL' mode by '<c-\><c-n>' (like tmux's '<c-b>' + left square
bracket).

This plugin has defined a '<m-q>' map for '<c-\><c-n>', which makes switching
to terminal normal mode a little easier.

If you want to re-enter 'INSERT' mode, just press 'i' or 'a', and you can input
shell commands again.

                                                    *terminal_help-integration*
Integration ~

This plugin defined a runner 'thelp' for asyncrun.vim [2], which enables you
use terminal-help to execute asyncrun commands:
>
  :AsyncRun -mode=term -pos=thelp echo 123
<
And it is also useful when you are using asynctasks.vim [3]:
>
  [test-task]
  command=echo 123
  output=terminal
  pos=thelp
<
You can either set 'g:asynctasks_term_pos' to 'thelp' or use 'pos' field in
task option directly. After this:
>
  :AsyncTask test-task
<
Can run the task in the terminal-help's window.
